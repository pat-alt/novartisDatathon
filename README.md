# novartisDatathon

This repo was used by our team for the 2020 [Novartis Datathon](https://godatathon.com/). It collects all code used for prediction and presentation purposes. Our team consisted of four class mates who at the time of the event were studying for an MSc Data Science at [Barcelona Graduate School of Economics](https://www.barcelonagse.eu/study/masters-programs/data-science-methodology):

- Patrick Altmeyer
- Eduard Gimenez
- Jakob PÃ¶rschmann
- Simon Neumeyer

For all of us this was our first ever participation in a datathon/hackathon and an incredibly rewarding experience.
